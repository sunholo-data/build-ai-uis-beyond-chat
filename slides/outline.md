# Slide outline — Build AI UIs Beyond Chat (activity-led)

The talk is a sequence of self-contained decks played in order through
[`presenter.html`](presenter.html). Intro + wrap are instructor decks; the middle
is **student-led activity cards** that double as a self-paced course guide on the
website. This file is the **source of truth** for deck order and per-deck minutes
— keep the `PLAYLIST` in `presenter.html` in sync.

Full pedagogy + running order: [`../agenda2.md`](../agenda2.md).

**Budget:** 160 min on the clock + 10-min break (paused) ≈ **170 min**, leaving
buffer inside a 3-hour half-day.

\* Round B is a **jigsaw**: groups each do *one* protocol in parallel, so the
40-min round budget sits on `B0`; `B1`–`B3` are reference cards (0 min) the
facilitator can project per track.

## Timekeeping (the organising tool)

The presenter ships a per-deck timer + schedule tracker — use it to run the room:

- **Wall clock, top-right:** click to **start/pause**, double-click to reset.
- **Bottom bar:** `Block M:SS / budget` with a colour bar (green → amber at 80% →
  orange over), `Total M:SS / 170:00`, and a **±delta pill** (green = ahead,
  orange = behind). Budgets are the `minutes` above.
- **Break:** click the clock to **pause** for the 10-min break so the delta stays
  honest, then click again to resume.
- **Round B:** start the timer when groups begin; it banks 40 min against `B0`
  while you flip to `B1`/`B2`/`B3` to show a track (those read 0:00 — expected).

## Demo thread — two real apps, used throughout

Each protocol is shown as the clean demo skill, then the same protocol shipping in
a real fork of the platform; in Round B groups play with one (homespun vs protocol,
via the dev playgrounds).

| Protocol | Clean demo skill | Real app | Round B — play with it (key-free unless noted) | Advanced reconstruct |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AG-UI | `demo-researcher` | GDE pipeline visualizer · AIPLA tutor | read the live SSE stream in DevTools *(needs a reply)* | restore `onMessagesChanged` (`B1`) |
| A2UI | `demo-form-builder` → `demo-workspace` | GDE `InvoiceHeroCard` · AIPLA workspace | `/dev/a2ui` — edit the A2UI JSON, watch it render | restore `default_surface` (`B2`) |
| MCP Apps | `demo-map-explorer` | GDE dashboards (bidirectional) · AIPLA `led-planck` | `/dev/mcp-apps/active` — fire both channels through the bridge | restore the `update-model-context` POST (`B3`) |

> **Live-demo caveat:** demo skills run locally (`LOCAL_MODE=1`); the real apps
> are on Cloud Run and the AIPLA teacher link may need sign-in. Decide per moment
> whether to click through live or show a capture.

## Status legend

- ✅ **reused** — standard book-end deck from `sunholo-data/presentations`.
- 🟢 **activity / drafted** — real content; refine copy.
- 🟡 **draft** — framing decks; expand as needed.

The Round-B exercises live in the workshop fork
([build-ai-uis-workshop-app](https://github.com/sunholo-data/build-ai-uis-workshop-app)):
`docs/exercises/{agui,a2ui,mcp}.md` (homespun-vs-protocol + the dev playgrounds),
with the optional reconstruct blanks on the `workshop-start` branch (each anchored
by a test). Built and verified — no longer a TODO.
